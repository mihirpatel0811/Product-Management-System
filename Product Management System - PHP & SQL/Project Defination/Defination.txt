--------------------------------------------------Implementation Considerations--------------------------------------------------
Frontend Technologies

    HTML/CSS: For structure and styling of the web pages.
    JavaScript: For client-side interactivity (e.g., form validation, dynamic content updates).
    Frameworks: Consider using frameworks like Bootstrap for responsive design or React/Vue.js for a more dynamic user experience.

Backend Technologies

    PHP: For server-side scripting to handle requests, process data, and interact with the database.
    SQL: For database operations (CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Database Management

    Use MySQL or any other relational database management system to create and manage the database and tables.
    Ensure proper indexing for efficient querying, especially for the search functionality.

Security

    Implement user authentication and authorization.
    Use password hashing (e.g., bcrypt) for storing passwords securely.
    Validate and sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.

User Experience

    Ensure the interface is user-friendly and intuitive.
    Provide feedback messages for actions (e.g., successful registration, errors).
    Consider implementing pagination for the product, category, and brand lists if they grow large.

This structured approach outlines the development of a comprehensive Product Management System that meets the specified requirements 
while ensuring a smooth user experience and robust backend functionality.
